Use this project at your own risk

The idea behind this is a tool for batocera using pygame to have a controller friendly experience in setting up mario kart wii mods
currently it supports retro rewind but in the future I wish to add more to install this just unzip the repo inside of the pygame folder
in the roms directory. Then you can have fun installing retro rewind and updating it.
